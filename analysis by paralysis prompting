Prompting Past the Paralysis

> “Paralysis by analysis.”
I always thought it was just a decision-making trap — until I started prompting.



At first, I wanted the perfect prompt: well-worded, structured, stylish. I'd type, delete, tweak, hesitate. I was dancing around the prompt like it was a fragile glass sculpture. Then I realized...

Prompting isn’t about perfection. It’s about momentum.

Each messy draft teaches. Each vague idea reveals something. The magic is in the iteration, not the elegance.

Now, I prompt like I’m murmur-thinking out loud. Sometimes I type exactly what’s in my head and refine from there:

> "How would a monk explain burnout to a tech bro?"
"Give me 3 habits that help mental health, casual tone."
"Make it sound like a morning radio joke."



That’s the beauty — it’s alive, evolving, and responsive. You don’t need to know the whole route. You just need to ask the first question.

The cure for analysis paralysis in prompting?
👉 Just prompt anyway. Then prompt again.
