## ü™û Prompting Like I Talk

Lately, I've been reflecting on how my love for deep conversations mirrors the kind of prompting I naturally lean toward ‚Äî the thoughtful, layered, pattern-based kind.

I‚Äôve realized something:

> **Prompting is just conversation with a model.**  
> And if you value depth in human conversations, you‚Äôll find that same depth waiting in your prompts.

I used to think prompting was just technical ‚Äî like issuing clean commands.  
Now I see it more like inviting a reflection, planting a seed, or sparking insight.
